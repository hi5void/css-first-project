	<p>Isha Foundation is dedicated to raising human consciousness, and fosters global harmony through individual transformation. Guided by Sadhguru, it is an essential resource for exploring the ancient science of yoga in all its depth and dimensions. The foundation offers a variety of programs that provide methods for anyone to attain physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing. Its offerings allow participants to deepen their experience of life, and reach their ultimate potential.</p>

	<p>
    Sadhguru is a man whose passion spills into everything he encounters. A fearless rebel from the start, his childhood was punctuated with solitary forays into the jungle for days at a stretch, snake-catching and class cutting. In youth, his blunt clarity into life made him an unofficial counselor to his problem-ridden college mates. His love of adventure led him on motorcycle expeditions, and his early business endeavors into poultry farming and construction were met with success. Just when you’ve summed him up as a cool maverick, he surprises you with a gentle side that can shed tears of compassion and extract laughter from hardened faces. Equally at home with bright-eyed village children, ash-smeared yogis and top-notch executives, Sadhguru defies any narrow description. With a keen mind, balanced by a heart that knows no boundary, he infects his zest for life into all who seek to live their lives to the fullest.

	Man And Machine
	His fascination with wheels traces back to his youth. Spur-of-the moment motorcycle expeditions took him riding across the Indian subcontinent. Even if these days he seems to have simmered down to driving four-wheelers, those riding with him will tell you about the ease, speed and precision with which he maneuvers on all kinds of terrains, from rocky off-roads to Indian highways.
        </p>
<p>
	Globetrotter
	Known to have an “inhuman schedule,” with over 20 hours a day of incessant transitions between programs, meetings and phone calls, a flurry of engagements make him play hopscotch from one country to the next. But he always makes time to see the sights, meet the people, and immerse himself in the places he visits.
        </p>
<p>
	Poet
	Poems burst forth in rivulets of ink, scrawled across pages of a notebook. Deciphering his handwriting not a simple task – some are clear, some obscure – but here you can find a collection in readable font!
        </p>
<p>
	Of Flora…
	In a day and age where many of us would be totally lost in the wild, Sadhguru, as the child he was and the mystic he is now, has always been in deep communication with nature.
        </p>
        <p>

	Snakes
	He enjoys a close friendship with these graceful reptiles. In his childhood, Sadhguru was an expert in anything to do with snakes. Later he shared his room with over 20 poisonous snakes, including cobras and vipers.
